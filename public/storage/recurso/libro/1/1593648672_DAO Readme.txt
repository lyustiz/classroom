                       README FOR UPDATED DAO350.DLL 
                         FOR MICROSOFT(R) EXCEL 97

The revised Dao350.dll file that is included in the Newdao.exe 
file corrects a problem that prevents you from running Visual Basic(R)
for Applications macros that use Data Access Objects (DAO). Without
this revised Da0350.dll, the macro may fail and you may receive the 
following error message:

   Run-time error '40009':
   No current row.

NOTE: This is the same Dao350.dll that is included with Microsoft 
Excel 97 for Windows(R). The version and date of Dao350.dll have been 
changed to prevent Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0 (or a Visual 
Basic application that uses DAO) from replacing it with a version of 
the file that has a later date but that is not fully compatible with 
Microsoft Excel 97.

To correct the problem, follow these steps:

1. Close all programs.

2. On the Start menu, point to Find, and click Files Or Folders.

3. In the Named box, type "Dao350.dll" (without the quotation marks). 
   In the Look In box, select "(C:)" (or the hard disk drive 
   in which Microsoft Windows is located). Click to select the 
   Include Subfolders check box, and then click Find Now.

   One copy of the original Dao350.dll should be in the following
   folder

      <WinDrv>\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao

   where <WinDrv> is the disk drive letter for the hard disk on 
   which Windows is installed.

4. Right-click each Dao350.dll file. On the shortcut menu, click 
   Rename. Change the name of the file to "Dao350.vb5" (without 
   the quotation marks). Press ENTER.

   These files are backup copies of the existing Dao350.dll files.

5. Start Microsoft(R) Windows Explorer and open the following folder

      <WinDrv>\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao

   where <WinDrv> is the disk drive letter for the hard disk
   on which Windows is installed.

6. Copy the downloaded Dao350.dll into the folder you opened in
   step 5.

You can now safely install Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0 (or
Microsoft Visual Basic applications that use DAO) without affecting
DAO in Visual Basic for Applications.
